## Hotkey Text Extender

This is a tool for the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notetaking tool.

This tool allows for the user to use a keybind to insert a text snippet.
It was made to add \<br> statements without needing to type 4 characters.

### Currently Supported Characters


Key Binding|Snippet
---|---
Cmd+1|\<br>

Currently, I am not sure how to get this plugin in the "offical" Obsidian Community Plugins tab (nor is it anywhere close to being done), so you will need to download it manually.

### Manual Download:
1) Clone the repo into VAULT/.obsidian/plugins
2) Go into the cloned hotkey-text-extender directory
3) Run 'npm i' to download needed dependencies
4) Run 'npm run build' to build
5) Restart Obsidian and go to:
    Settings -> Options -> Community Plugins
6) Make sure Safe Mode is Off
7) You should now see Hotkey Text Extender under Installed Plugins
8) Turn on the plugin and enjoy!
